              <p>A project is normally constrained by time, scope and cost. These are referred to as “triple constraint”. Time indicates the project duration or how is it projected over a specific schedule. Scope defines the extend of responsibilities to accomplish during the project or the specific tasks that will be carried out. Cost involves the budged available to spend on resources to complete the project (Augsburg Education, 2012).</p>

              <p>As units pass by, it became apparent that it was hard to handle a big group as a PM. Most tasks were carried out by the same group of people, which know each other from other modules. It has been hard to drive others to engage the group activities, and it is always easier to work with those you already know. In a real-world scenario, most people would show interest in their PM opinions because their jobs depend on them. But in an academic environment, it is easy to concentrate on other tasks while paying little attention to the activities established by the designated PM.</p>
              <p>This disconnection between group members also became apparent in the other team when they showed some differences between previously agreed points with our group.</p>
              <p class = "lead">Seminar Tasks</p>
              <p>Regarding unit activities, the Volere site did not represent a trustworthy resource for me because it had several quality issues on its pages. To name a few, there were typos, repeated phrases, and the WordPress icon still as the site icon.</p>
              <p class = "lead">Seminar discussion</p>
              
              <p>The seminar was very helpful to discuss different points of view about Data Structure applications. It is a subject that is very important in my current job and that I want to explore further in the future. The examples discussed were informative and practical because they match many of the real-life applications that we can encounter.  </p>

              <p>Since the hardware is continuously sending information that must be received in a centralized system, the most efficient data structure for processing packets is the Queue. Once it is received, it can be further processed in the same order that it has been received for classification through Big-Data software (Morton & Song, 2007).</p>
