It is critical to apply this knowledge from the beginning of every project to avoid potential problems. A good design is always more straightforward to discuss, modify and maintain. I found the Lucid Chart tool extremely valuable and powerful. Companies such as Amazon use these tools in a regular basis to support their teams.</p>
              <p>At first glance, many of the concepts of composition vs aggregation appear confusing. We hold interesting discussions about how to enhance the design in the practical activity, where it was evident that there is a thin line between these concepts and require more practice and research in the upcoming modules. This was very positive to the group, helping us to see our blunders and to get a more reliable understanding of the reasoning process of others.</p> -->

              <p>In the Annual Reports published by the Data Protection Commission, a case in 2017 describes the use of CCTV footage in a disciplinary process. In this case, the complainant filed a claim at the Commission stating that his employer did not notify him about the possibility of using this footage in such proceedings (Data Protection Commission, 2020). The complainant was disciplined and dismissed by the company after reviewing the CCTV footage. They confirmed that he was away from the control room where he was assigned to monitor the cameras while on duty as a security officer, compromising the security of the client’s premises.</p>
              <p>The employer argued that before assigning the employee to the task where he was recorded, he was asked to read a document stating his responsibilities and signing a certificate of acceptance of these terms. The employer also argued that they had a legitimate interest to process the personal data from the CCTV footage, to protect its reputation and financial liability, since they had a contractual obligation to safeguard the client’s premises.</p>
              <p>The Commissioner considered that the employer had the legal basis to use the CCTV footage based on the Section 2A(1)(d) of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 (Data Protection Act, 1998), which states that “the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the data controller”.</p>

              <p>Hi Kike,</p>
              <p>I found your post very interesting, and I also agree that increasing staff training in cybersecurity or at least network security would beneficiate hospitals implementing these training systems. It could even help detect some failures that the manufacturer of such training devices (such as the health mannequin) could have missed. It is still the responsibility of the mannequin provider to test it against every possible intrusion, using penetration testing and ethical hacking techniques. This issue will become more and more evident as Smart devices and AI applications are scattered through the health ecosystem (Perumal et al., 2021).</p>
              <p>From the point of view of manufacturers, it seems they are not planning the security measures that might be necessary to tackle future threats. I wonder what you think about how the target customer of the mannequin, could have influenced the low security of the mannequin. A simple update of the internal network router might correct the issue that allowed an attacker to take advantage of the WPS vulnerability (Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, 2012).</p>

              <p class="fst-italic">"Hi Kikelomo,</p>
              <p class="fst-italic">It seems that this example showcases a complete failure of several components of an information system. The hardware component along with network and communications components were not planned accordingly to such an important task. The software component also failed, making it impossible to print out vote results. </p>              
              <p class="fst-italic">It could be argued that the other components of the information system also failed. For example, the people component comprises all those involved in the process, from the testers to the officers who validated the system despite criticism and problems. The data and process components did not deliver the required results for the information system. All the components work together, and it might be considered that only the software failed, but in the end, it is a whole system where every component plays its part to make it work successfully."</p>

              <p>During the first weeks of this module, we went through the phases of the software development lifecycle, researching the importance of every step in order to efficiently build a project that meets the client’s requirements. A well-designed and implemented software must be maintainable and extensible. It is an essential piece of an information system, along with the other components such as hardware, data, processes and people. They all must work highly coupled to provide a robust framework.</p>
              <p>We came across several examples of how even a small component of an information system might cause a catastrophic failure. It is the responsibility of every member of a team to work with the strongest of ethics to provide a service with the highest standards. We have seen examples of our fellow students that show how the quality of our work can impact the reputation of a company, the security of a critical facility, communications and transport of a whole country (Goodley, 2018), and even the freedom or the life of others (Prodger, 2013). We learned how every aspect should be considered when designing an information system. Complexity, resources, time, ethics, governance and team experience should all be carefully examined before committing.</p>
              <p>Another important concept researched during this module is Object-oriented software development. It is among the tools that provide a methodology to develop complex systems, focusing on the objects of a problem to provide a design that is maintainable, extensible and easy to read. With the increasing complexity of modern information systems, new challenges arise, making Object-Oriented Design harder to implement. It is very important to distinguish when to implement OOP (Aniche et al., 2019).</p>              
              <p>To sum up, we have gained valuable knowledge about tools and methods that must be considered when participating in the software development lifecycle. We have a clear understanding of the importance of requirements gathering, testing and selecting the right methodology for implementation.</p>

              <p class="lead">There are many advantages to this approach such as modularity, which makes it easier to maintain and expand, correct bugs, etc. OOD can improve reliability, flexibility and reusability. However, there are weaknesses if not used correctly or if the technique is abused, making the system hard and costly to integrate with other systems.</p>

              <p>Abstraction: removes most superfluous details to leave the most important aspects of the object, so it is easier to use for other types. It represents a reusable, generic object.</p>
              <p>Encapsulation: it is the concept of joining methods and states (functions and attributes) together in a class. The data is not accessed directly but through the methods inside a class.</p>              
              <p>Inheritance: having a master class (or super class), other objects can inherit its characteristics (parent to child inheritance). In this case we say that the child is coupled with its parent (super class). Any changes made to the super class, will be transferred to the sub-class.</p>              
              <p>Polymorphism: occurs when more than one object inherits from a parent class, overriding its default behaviours, while keeping the IS-A relationship with its parent. One object can then take on many forms. </p>
