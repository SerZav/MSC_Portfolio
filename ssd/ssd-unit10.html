              <p>In this unit we studied the TrueCrypt cryptanalysis by Junestam & Guigo (2014). The TrueCrypt authors claimed that their software was not secure because it could have some vulnerabilities. We have discussed with our peers if the cryptanalysis proves or disproves this assumption. We also commented on whether we would recommend this software to a friend as a secure storage protection.</p>

              <p>Being a full-time developer, I did not find most of the Codio activities challenging, but they introduced me to new tools and good literature. I had previous experience with bug-checking tools such as Pylint, but eventually, I stopped using them. I recognize they are essential, and I should make a habit of using them. I enjoyed concepts like ontology or cyclomatic complexity, but I feel that there was not enough attention to design patterns, and especially SOLID principles, which more than a metric, are good practices to improve code quality, extensibility and therefore, security.</p>
              <p>As for operating systems and virtualization, I missed some content and hands-on exercises with containers and other related concepts. I understand that the shell itself was a good exercise that consumed some time, so maybe I would have appreciated these two concepts in separate weeks to have a better insight.</p>

              <p>I enjoyed your very detailed and interesting post. Focusing on the weaknesses that you have pointed out, do you think it is safe to say that after the auditing of the software, TrueCrypt would be safe to use after a small patch? Many of the open-source follow-ups to TrueCrypt such as VeraCrypt, had the same vulnerabilities but they corrected them. Also, in 2015, Google’s Project Zero found the first high severity vulnerability in TrueCrypt (Joseph Cox, 30 September 2015), which has a base score of 7.8 in the NIST database (NIST, 2017). It was not clear if this critical bug was also an unintentional error or a deliberate backdoor to the software, and probably one of the reasons behind the sudden TrueCrypt closure.</p>
              <p>There are several important measures to prevent the risks you have emphasised when it comes to software development. One of the most important would be to carefully check the OWASP vulnerability list, to avoid common errors related to memory, buffers, leaks, and many other risks especially associated with languages such as C. Design patterns are also a must in a project planned to be maintainable, readable and open to modifications. As an open-source project, the lack of more robust management could lead to some design flaws that could eventually make the project hard to sustain.</p>

              <p>I have enjoyed your insights about the TrueCrypt case. I would only add that in 2015, Google’s Project Zero found the first high severity vulnerability in TrueCrypt (Joseph Cox, 30 September 2015), which has a base score of 7.8 in the NIST database. Although no vulnerabilities have been found that could affect the encryption of data, the most severe risk is the possibility to take control of the computer giving the attacker permission to elevate his privileges (NIST, 2017).</p>
              <p>According to the inconsistencies and incidents you have detailed, there are several design aspects that should have been considered. The OWASP vulnerability list is a good starting point that needs to be reviewed, specially when a language like C is used where many buffer or memory errors can compromise the whole system. Several of the vulnerabilities found during the audit project are related to memory dumps where data can be extracted from the disk.</p>
              <p>Other recommendations include the use of design patterns and implementation of SOLID principles to ensure that code remains open to extensions, maintainable, and readable. As the audit team suggested, the use of comments would highly increase the readability. Modules in this type of project should be decoupled so that any team involved in the project can easily continue with updates and maintenance without risking other modules.</p>

              <p>During the first weeks of this module, we went through the phases of the software development lifecycle, researching the importance of every step in order to efficiently build a project that meets the client’s requirements. A well-designed and implemented software must be maintainable and extensible. It is an essential piece of an information system, along with the other components such as hardware, data, processes and people. They all must work highly coupled to provide a robust framework.</p>
              <p>We came across several examples of how even a small component of an information system might cause a catastrophic failure. It is the responsibility of every member of a team to work with the strongest of ethics to provide a service with the highest standards. We have seen examples of our fellow students that show how the quality of our work can impact the reputation of a company, the security of a critical facility, communications and transport of a whole country (Goodley, 2018), and even the freedom or the life of others (Prodger, 2013). We learned how every aspect should be considered when designing an information system. Complexity, resources, time, ethics, governance and team experience should all be carefully examined before committing.</p>
              <p>Another important concept researched during this module is Object-oriented software development. It is among the tools that provide a methodology to develop complex systems, focusing on the objects of a problem to provide a design that is maintainable, extensible and easy to read. With the increasing complexity of modern information systems, new challenges arise, making Object-Oriented Design harder to implement. It is very important to distinguish when to implement OOP (Aniche et al., 2019).</p>              
              <p>To sum up, we have gained valuable knowledge about tools and methods that must be considered when participating in the software development lifecycle. We have a clear understanding of the importance of requirements gathering, testing and selecting the right methodology for implementation.</p>
