              <p>In this unit, we delved deeper into the components of an information system and could identify which ones of those components were failing in the case studies of the forum discussion. These components are divided into three categories: technology, people and process. We tend to distinguish only a failing phase in a system development lifecycle (i.e. testing), but it is also important to check on the components of an information system.</p>
              <p>I need to work on my skills to differentiate and spot a potential risk in the components of an information system. I enjoyed the seminar discussion about the fails in the En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) system, where we could see how such a critical information system is susceptible to problems if one of these components fails. I think it is very important to keep learning from this type of failure in complex systems.</p>

              <p>Between 6 and 7 December 2018, a software failure brought the O2 network down, affecting data services for more than 30 million users in the UK. Other companies that relied on O2 network such as Lycamobile, Giffgaff, Sky Mobile and Tesco Mobile were also affected. London’s bus stop screens and systems aboard more than 8500 London buses also failed due to this incident (Goodley, 2018). O2 offered several types of compensation for its customers depending on their plan, including discounts or credit of days’ worth charges.</p>
              <p>The failure was caused by an out-of-date licence in a software used by several hardware devices distributed by Ericsson. In total, 11 countries were affected by this failure, causing considerable reputation and monetary damage. O2 was asking for a compensation of as much as 100 million pounds from Ericsson (Goodley, 2018).</p>              
              <p>Ericsson (2018: 1) declared:</p>              
              <p>“During December 6, 2018, Ericsson has identified an issue in certain nodes in the core network resulting in network disturbances for a limited number of customers in multiple countries using two specific software versions of the SGSN–MME”.</p>
              <p>In another press release, SoftBank Corp., a Japanese telecommunications company apologized for the incident that affected their mobile customers nationwide (SoftBank Corp., 2018).</p>

              <p class="lead">Solomon presented an interesting case study where system complexity was highly underestimated. The Queensland health authority in Australia probably made the wrong choice when hiring IBM, even though they did not have experience in similar projects at the time.<p/>
              <hr>
              <p>It seems this is a good example of how to do everything wrong. The healthcare authority was slow to audit and keep track of progress, which brings the first big problem: governance.</p>
              <p>Strictly speaking about the information system design, there was deficient documentation of requirements for a system of such enormous complexity. The time commitment for the initial delivery seemed too short, and without a strict testing plan, it was an impossible task. These issues can be summarized as communication failure. In a project of this size, every effort must be directed toward stablishing good lines of communication between the consultants and every required personnel inside the company.</p>              
              <p>Grierson (2013: 9) stated: “Department of education, health and CorpTech senior officers were openly critical of the performance of IBM and I was concerned for the future of the relationship with IBM and hence the project”.</p>

              <p class="lead">Kikelomo brought to our attention an interesting case of failure during the 2004 Irish elections, where the Irish government tried to replace the manual voting system by an electronic one. The system turned out to be flawed and had to be discarded just 5 days prior to the elections.<p/>
              <hr>
              <p class="fst-italic">"Hi Kikelomo,</p>
              <p class="fst-italic">It seems that this example showcases a complete failure of several components of an information system. The hardware component along with network and communications components were not planned accordingly to such an important task. The software component also failed, making it impossible to print out vote results. </p>              
              <p class="fst-italic">It could be argued that the other components of the information system also failed. For example, the people component comprises all those involved in the process, from the testers to the officers who validated the system despite criticism and problems. The data and process components did not deliver the required results for the information system. All the components work together, and it might be considered that only the software failed, but in the end, it is a whole system where every component plays its part to make it work successfully."</p>

              <p>During the first weeks of this module, we went through the phases of the software development lifecycle, researching the importance of every step in order to efficiently build a project that meets the client’s requirements. A well-designed and implemented software must be maintainable and extensible. It is an essential piece of an information system, along with the other components such as hardware, data, processes and people. They all must work highly coupled to provide a robust framework.</p>
              <p>We came across several examples of how even a small component of an information system might cause a catastrophic failure. It is the responsibility of every member of a team to work with the strongest of ethics to provide a service with the highest standards. We have seen examples of our fellow students that show how the quality of our work can impact the reputation of a company, the security of a critical facility, communications and transport of a whole country (Goodley, 2018), and even the freedom or the life of others (Prodger, 2013). We learned how every aspect should be considered when designing an information system. Complexity, resources, time, ethics, governance and team experience should all be carefully examined before committing.</p>
              <p>Another important concept researched during this module is Object-oriented software development. It is among the tools that provide a methodology to develop complex systems, focusing on the objects of a problem to provide a design that is maintainable, extensible and easy to read. With the increasing complexity of modern information systems, new challenges arise, making Object-Oriented Design harder to implement. It is very important to distinguish when to implement OOP (Aniche et al., 2019).</p>              
              <p>To sum up, we have gained valuable knowledge about tools and methods that must be considered when participating in the software development lifecycle. We have a clear understanding of the importance of requirements gathering, testing and selecting the right methodology for implementation.</p>
