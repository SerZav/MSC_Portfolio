              <p>In this unit we studied the TrueCrypt cryptanalysis by Junestam & Guigo (2014). The TrueCrypt authors claimed that their software was not secure because it could have some vulnerabilities. We have discussed with our peers if the cryptanalysis proves or disproves this assumption. We also commented on whether we would recommend this software to a friend as a secure storage protection.</p>

              <p>TrueCrypt is an encryption tool that became famous after news claiming that the FBI failed to hack this software (Zhang, L. et al, 2019). However, TrueCrypt development suddenly stopped in 2014 with no further notice. Since the authors of this encryption tool remain anonymous, the reasons behind this abrupt closure are still unknown. Some speculations point out that it could be a way to warn users about a National Security demand to deliver user’s data; others consider that it could be an easy way out before a critical flaw was identified, or just letting the community know that they were just tired of the project and it will not be maintained anymore (Alex Hern, 30 May 2014).</p>
              <p>The analysis performed by iSEC engineers found several vulnerabilities on the TrueCrypt software, concluding that the software was not secure, thus proving the statement of the TrueCrypt authors that using their software was not secure. However, there were no high severity vulnerabilities found and the rest had some easy fixes that could have been patched in forthcoming versions.</p>
              <p>In 2015, the first critical vulnerability in TrueCrypt was found by Google’s Project Zero, a team that analyses popular software for vulnerabilities and bugs (Joseph Cox, 30 September 2015). The critical vulnerability was classified under the code CVE-2015-7358 of the National Vulnerability Database and it can be exploited by granting access to the computer, allowing the attacker to obtain elevated privileges (NIST, 2017).</p>
              <p>I would not recommend using TrueCrypt to anyone because it has several vulnerabilities including a critical one, and it has not been patched or updated since the vulnerabilities have been exposed. There are other open-source projects such as VeraCrypt, which are being maintained and have corrected these vulnerabilities.</p>

              <p>I enjoyed your very detailed and interesting post. Focusing on the weaknesses that you have pointed out, do you think it is safe to say that after the auditing of the software, TrueCrypt would be safe to use after a small patch? Many of the open-source follow-ups to TrueCrypt such as VeraCrypt, had the same vulnerabilities but they corrected them. Also, in 2015, Google’s Project Zero found the first high severity vulnerability in TrueCrypt (Joseph Cox, 30 September 2015), which has a base score of 7.8 in the NIST database (NIST, 2017). It was not clear if this critical bug was also an unintentional error or a deliberate backdoor to the software, and probably one of the reasons behind the sudden TrueCrypt closure.</p>
              <p>There are several important measures to prevent the risks you have emphasised when it comes to software development. One of the most important would be to carefully check the OWASP vulnerability list, to avoid common errors related to memory, buffers, leaks, and many other risks especially associated with languages such as C. Design patterns are also a must in a project planned to be maintainable, readable and open to modifications. As an open-source project, the lack of more robust management could lead to some design flaws that could eventually make the project hard to sustain.</p>

              <p>I have enjoyed your insights about the TrueCrypt case. I would only add that in 2015, Google’s Project Zero found the first high severity vulnerability in TrueCrypt (Joseph Cox, 30 September 2015), which has a base score of 7.8 in the NIST database. Although no vulnerabilities have been found that could affect the encryption of data, the most severe risk is the possibility to take control of the computer giving the attacker permission to elevate his privileges (NIST, 2017).</p>
              <p>According to the inconsistencies and incidents you have detailed, there are several design aspects that should have been considered. The OWASP vulnerability list is a good starting point that needs to be reviewed, specially when a language like C is used where many buffer or memory errors can compromise the whole system. Several of the vulnerabilities found during the audit project are related to memory dumps where data can be extracted from the disk.</p>
              <p>Other recommendations include the use of design patterns and implementation of SOLID principles to ensure that code remains open to extensions, maintainable, and readable. As the audit team suggested, the use of comments would highly increase the readability. Modules in this type of project should be decoupled so that any team involved in the project can easily continue with updates and maintenance without risking other modules.</p>
