              <p>I am submitting this post on behalf of Team C. The following summary contains details of the basic scanning/host identification tools which can be used to gain information about a domain or the associated IP address space. All commands below were run on a clean Ubuntu 20.04 LTS install within WSL2 on Windows 10.</p>
              <p class="fw-bold"><i class="fas fa-check-square"></i>Number of hops from originating machine to the destination website:</p>
              <p>In order to get the number of hops between the originating PC and the destination website, the Traceroute tool was used. The Traceroute tool is a command-line utility which can be used to trace the path that an IP packet takes to its destination (Microsoft, n.d.).</p>
              <p><span class="fw-bold">Command:</span> traceroute -I Nismphp-env.eba-kptvqjff.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com</p>
              <p><span class="fw-bold">Result:</span> When executing the above command on my PC, there were 7 responses to the traceroute query. The longest delay was within steps 8 and 9, which took 106.091 and 105.324 ms to respond to the request.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p class="fw-bold"><i class="fas fa-check-square"></i>Main nameservers for the website:</p>
              <p>In order to get details of the websites nameservers, we were required to use the dig utility against the root domain (elasticbeanstalk.com). The dig utility provides an interface for interrogating DNS servers, returning the results to the user (IBM, n.d.).</p>
              <p><span class="fw-bold">Command:</span> dig 8.8.8.8 elasticbeanstalk.com NS</p>
              <p><span class="fw-bold">Result:</span> This query was executed using the Google Public DNS servers. A total of 4 nameservers which were responsible for the resolution of *.elasticbeanstalk.com were returned, all of which were in the following format: ‘ns-{num}.awsdns-{num}.{tld}’.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p class="fw-bold"><i class="fas fa-check-square"></i>Registered contact for the website:</p>
              <p>In order to get the details of the registered contact for the site, we were required to run the whois utility against the root domain (elasticbeanstalk.com). The whois utility provides access to data about a domain and its owners held by ICANN accredited registrars (ICANN, n.d.), which help maintain the integrity of the domain name and website ownership processes (DomainTools, n.d.).</p>
              <p><span class="fw-bold">Command:</span> whois elasticbeanstalk.com</p>
              <p><span class="fw-bold">Result:</span> This query returned the WHOIS data of the ElasticBeanstalk root domain, including the registrant details and the abuse contacts.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p class="fw-bold"><i class="fas fa-check-square"></i>MX Record for the website:</p>
              <p>In order to get the MX record for the site, we were required to run the dig utility against the root domain (elasticbeanstalk.com). An MX record is also known as a ‘Mail Exchange’ record, which directs email messages to a specific server (Cloudflare, n.d.).</p>
              <p><span class="fw-bold">Command:</span> dig 8.8.8.8 elasticbeanstalk.com MX</p>
              <p><span class="fw-bold">Result:</span> No MX records existed for the elasticbeanstalk.com root domain.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p class="fw-bold"><i class="fas fa-check-square"></i>Website hosting details:</p>
              <p>In order to get details of the website host, we are first required to get the IP address of the responding server. This can then be queried using the whois utility, returning details about the organisation that owns the address space, as well as the RIR responsible for controlling the address space.</p>
              <p><span class="fw-bold">Command:</span> nslookup Nismphp-env.eba-kptvqjff.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com & whois 44.198.4.25</p>
              <p><span class="fw-bold">Result:</span> The nslookup command above resolved the domain provided by Team B to the IPV4 address of 44.198.4.25. When performing a WHOIS search on the IP address, it resolved to IP address space allocated to “Amazon Web Services, Inc.” issued by the ARIN regional address registry.</p>

              <p>Hi Kike,</p>
              <p>I found your post very interesting, and I also agree that increasing staff training in cybersecurity or at least network security would beneficiate hospitals implementing these training systems. It could even help detect some failures that the manufacturer of such training devices (such as the health mannequin) could have missed. It is still the responsibility of the mannequin provider to test it against every possible intrusion, using penetration testing and ethical hacking techniques. This issue will become more and more evident as Smart devices and AI applications are scattered through the health ecosystem (Perumal et al., 2021).</p>
              <p>From the point of view of manufacturers, it seems they are not planning the security measures that might be necessary to tackle future threats. I wonder what you think about how the target customer of the mannequin, could have influenced the low security of the mannequin. A simple update of the internal network router might correct the issue that allowed an attacker to take advantage of the WPS vulnerability (Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, 2012).</p>

              <p class="fst-italic">"Peer response:</p>
              <p class="fst-italic">I enjoyed your post very much since there are interesting facts about healthcare security. I agree with your measures to mitigate these attacks, especially when you talk about updating the firmware of the internal devices. This risk to brute force attacks was warned by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency back in 2012. The stated that a WPS vulnerability could be used by an attacker to get the router's password (Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, 2012).</p>              
              <p class="fst-italic">Additionally, I think that improving staff training in cybersecurity would beneficiate hospitals implementing these devices securely. It is an opportunity to keep the hospital safe and could help detecting vulnerabilities that the manufacturer could have missed in early stages of development. It is still the responsibility of the mannequin provider to test it against every possible intrusion, using penetration testing and ethical hacking techniques. This issue will become more and more evident as Smart devices and AI applications are scattered through the health ecosystem (Perumal et al., 2021)."</p>

              <p>During the first weeks of this module, we went through the phases of the software development lifecycle, researching the importance of every step in order to efficiently build a project that meets the client’s requirements. A well-designed and implemented software must be maintainable and extensible. It is an essential piece of an information system, along with the other components such as hardware, data, processes and people. They all must work highly coupled to provide a robust framework.</p>
              <p>We came across several examples of how even a small component of an information system might cause a catastrophic failure. It is the responsibility of every member of a team to work with the strongest of ethics to provide a service with the highest standards. We have seen examples of our fellow students that show how the quality of our work can impact the reputation of a company, the security of a critical facility, communications and transport of a whole country (Goodley, 2018), and even the freedom or the life of others (Prodger, 2013). We learned how every aspect should be considered when designing an information system. Complexity, resources, time, ethics, governance and team experience should all be carefully examined before committing.</p>
              <p>Another important concept researched during this module is Object-oriented software development. It is among the tools that provide a methodology to develop complex systems, focusing on the objects of a problem to provide a design that is maintainable, extensible and easy to read. With the increasing complexity of modern information systems, new challenges arise, making Object-Oriented Design harder to implement. It is very important to distinguish when to implement OOP (Aniche et al., 2019).</p>              
              <p>To sum up, we have gained valuable knowledge about tools and methods that must be considered when participating in the software development lifecycle. We have a clear understanding of the importance of requirements gathering, testing and selecting the right methodology for implementation.</p>

              <p class="lead">There are many advantages to this approach such as modularity, which makes it easier to maintain and expand, correct bugs, etc. OOD can improve reliability, flexibility and reusability. However, there are weaknesses if not used correctly or if the technique is abused, making the system hard and costly to integrate with other systems.</p>

              <p>Abstraction: removes most superfluous details to leave the most important aspects of the object, so it is easier to use for other types. It represents a reusable, generic object.</p>
              <p>Encapsulation: it is the concept of joining methods and states (functions and attributes) together in a class. The data is not accessed directly but through the methods inside a class.</p>              
              <p>Inheritance: having a master class (or super class), other objects can inherit its characteristics (parent to child inheritance). In this case we say that the child is coupled with its parent (super class). Any changes made to the super class, will be transferred to the sub-class.</p>              
              <p>Polymorphism: occurs when more than one object inherits from a parent class, overriding its default behaviours, while keeping the IS-A relationship with its parent. One object can then take on many forms. </p>
