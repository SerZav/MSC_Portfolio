              <p>We are surrounded by risks in our day-to-day activities, but we have learned to navigate through them since childhood. However, information systems represent a new and ever-changing world, with new dangers that emerge and challenge our knowledge, experience, and skills. It has been enlightening yet upsetting to know how even a medical mannequin can be compromised and represents a backdoor for attackers. Even after years of working with computers and servers, firewalls and antivirus, I feel that there are so many factors that can influence security that no protection is enough, and is always hard to keep knowledge sufficiently up to date.</p>

              <p>In a study to examine the risk of a production training resource's security being compromised by attackers, several vulnerabilities were found without implementing sophisticated resources. In this study performed by students with basic knowledge and limited tools, a medical mannequin was successfully attacked, demonstrating a low level of security implemented to protect these devices (Glisson et al., 2015).</p>
              <p>One of the vulnerabilities found in the security solution led to the successful use of a brute force attack to penetrate the internal router, which allowed access to the device. According to an alert from the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency in 2012, access points that support WPS are sensible of being breached by attackers in a time frame between 4 and 10 hours with open-source tools (Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, 2012). The steps to follow include updating the access point firmware and disabling the WPS. Therefore, it is essential to keep updated information on these alerts and reports about security.</p>
              <p>Attacks on WPS/WPS2 security can be greatly enhanced by using dictionaries. One of the most important measures to increase protection against these attacks is to perform penetration tests, with tools that measure the weakness of the security solution (Ajay et al., 2021). WPS3 however, has a more robust protection against password dictionary attacks and other vulnerabilities and adoption of devices with this protocol is advised (Lounis & Zulkernine, 2019).</p>
              <p>The second vulnerability found was related to the network protocol, which led to a denial of service, preventing the software to communicate with the mannequin. The most important measure to prevent DoS attacks or DDoS attacks in IoT devices is detection, for example monitoring network traffic. Other measures include prevention, by whitelisting the pre-approved devices allowed to connect to the device or implementing a firewall (Salim et al., 2020).</p>

              <p class="lead">Solomon presented an interesting case study where system complexity was highly underestimated. The Queensland health authority in Australia probably made the wrong choice when hiring IBM, even though they did not have experience in similar projects at the time.<p/>
              <hr>
              <p>It seems this is a good example of how to do everything wrong. The healthcare authority was slow to audit and keep track of progress, which brings the first big problem: governance.</p>
              <p>Strictly speaking about the information system design, there was deficient documentation of requirements for a system of such enormous complexity. The time commitment for the initial delivery seemed too short, and without a strict testing plan, it was an impossible task. These issues can be summarized as communication failure. In a project of this size, every effort must be directed toward stablishing good lines of communication between the consultants and every required personnel inside the company.</p>              
              <p>Grierson (2013: 9) stated: “Department of education, health and CorpTech senior officers were openly critical of the performance of IBM and I was concerned for the future of the relationship with IBM and hence the project”.</p>

The system turned out to be flawed and had to be discarded just 5 days prior to the elections.<p/>
              <hr>
              <p class="fst-italic">"Hi Kikelomo,</p>
              <p class="fst-italic">It seems that this example showcases a complete failure of several components of an information system. The hardware component along with network and communications components were not planned accordingly to such an important task. The software component also failed, making it impossible to print out vote results. </p>              
              <p class="fst-italic">It could be argued that the other components of the information system also failed. For example, the people component comprises all those involved in the process, from the testers to the officers who validated the system despite criticism and problems. The data and process components did not deliver the required results for the information system. All the components work together, and it might be considered that only the software failed, but in the end, it is a whole system where every component plays its part to make it work successfully."</p>

              <p>During the first weeks of this module, we went through the phases of the system development lifecycle, researching the importance of every step in order to efficiently build a project that meets the client’s requirements. A well-designed and implemented software must be maintainable and extensible. It is an essential piece of an information system, along with the other components such as hardware, data, processes and people. They all must work highly coupled to provide a robust framework.</p>
              <p>We came across several examples of how even a small component of an information system might cause a catastrophic failure. It is the responsibility of every member of a team to work with the strongest of ethics to provide a service with the highest standards. We have seen examples of our fellow students that show how the quality of our work can impact the reputation of a company, the security of a critical facility, communications and transport of a whole country (Goodley, 2018), and even the freedom or the life of others (Prodger, 2013). We learned how every aspect should be considered when designing an information system. Complexity, resources, time, ethics, governance and team experience should all be carefully examined before committing.</p>
              <p>Another important concept researched during this module is Object-oriented software development. It is among the tools that provide a methodology to develop complex systems, focusing on the objects of a problem to provide a design that is maintainable, extensible and easy to read. With the increasing complexity of modern information systems, new challenges arise, making Object-Oriented Design harder to implement. It is very important to distinguish when to implement OOP (Aniche et al., 2019).</p>              
              <p>To sum up, we have gained valuable knowledge about tools and methods that must be considered when participating in the system development lifecycle. We have a clear understanding of the importance of requirements gathering, testing and selecting the right methodology for implementation.</p>

              <p>Information systems focus on data collection, processing this data to finally offer knowledge for decision making. Ethics and governance are key words to take into consideration when gathering data and converting this data into useful knowledge.</p>

              <p>There are several factors that can affect building an information system. It is essential to use engineering techniques such as design patterns and good practices to avoid flawed software that is costly and hard to maintain and modify.</p>
              <p>Software engineering concentrates on producing a software solution from a design stage, going through several phases until deployment, and providing maintenance to keep the information system working until it is replaced or discontinued. This must be done considering budget and time.</p>
              <p>When designing a software solution, several characteristics must be considered:</p>
              <p>-	Target user</p>
              <p>-	Security and reliability</p>
              <p>-	Efficiency</p>
              <p>-	Maintainability</p>
