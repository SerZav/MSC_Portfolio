              <p>Going a step forward in the SDLC, I had the opportunity to get a better picture of agile methodologies, which I have found a little frustrating in the past. I had been using a mix of different approaches at work that led to some confusion. In a way, I think it was easier for me than for some peers to understand these concepts because I am involved in agile development. But I realize that there are different approaches and then some tweaks to introduce security into the equation. I still feel that I need so much more knowledge to possess the confidence to decide on the best approach in the best interest of a project.</p>

                <p>Insufficient session expiration is one of the weaknesses listed under the Broken Authentication category of the OWASP Top Ten (Category A2). It basically consists of letting the attacker to gain access to a system by using credentials that have not been released by the web site. A long expiration time can help the attacker to use the browser’s back button to retrieve the session if there is physical access to the machine. It can also be achieved by intercepting a package with the session information (MITRE, 2017).</p>
                <p>A recent example of important companies dealing with these vulnerabilities is SAP. According to the Centre for Internet Security (CIS, 2020) “Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in SAP products, the most severe of which could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute code on the affected systems”. Several systems were affected by different vulnerabilities including insufficient session expiration. Although there were no reports of these vulnerabilities being exploited, it shows how any production system may be vulnerable, therefore requiring exhaustive testing.</p>
                <p>The insufficient session expiration has been identified during deployment phase. Vulnerabilities at this stage normally occur due to lack of rigorous implementation procedures, testing or using of standard configurations. Other vulnerabilities that can be identified in this phase include session fixation and application misconfiguration (Disawal & Suman, 2021).</p>
                <p>The UML state machine diagram can represent the states where the system is vulnerable to an attack and how the attacker can gain access through the insufficient session expiration vulnerability,</p>

              <p>Thanks for sharing this information about Insufficient logging, which I have found very interesting and informative. Many of these attacks could be prevented by following the best security practices, diminishing the attack vectors. If the attacker successfully penetrates the system, it is very important to detect it on time (Kiprin, 2021).</p>
              <p>It is interesting to study some of the threats associated with this vulnerability:</p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-circle small"></i> Botnets: automated attacks from multiple devices, normally manipulated through malware can attack a system in multiple ways. They can perform brute force attacks, phishing, and DDoS. The first line of protection against botnets is the logging information.</p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-circle small"></i> DNS attacks: it is important that DNS handles the data toward the correct server. If the destination server is manipulated, it can be routed to a malicious server. Correct information logging can detect this behaviour. Some DNS attacks include DNS tunnelling, domain look-up, cache poisoning, among others.</p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-circle small"></i> Insider threats: most companies keep exhaustive logging information while monitoring external intervention. But it is just as important to maintain comprehensive logging information of internal activity. Many internal malicious activities go unnoticed due to insufficient logging of internal events.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>Great presentation of the model and understanding of this vulnerability. I agree with the statement that testing is fundamental to be protected against cross-site scripting. Including XSS protection early in the software development life cycle in the form of unit-testing for example, can reduce costs for reputation and security experts’ diagnostic after an attack has successfully penetrated a system (Mohammadi et al., 2017).</p>
                <p>It is interesting to note that vulnerability detection based on artificial intelligence is gaining popularity, especially because traditional methods seem inefficient, especially against cross-site scripting attacks (Mahmoud et al., 2020). New predictive models are being used to detect vulnerabilities by analysing the source code of the application, which can be more effective than using generic solutions that might not work for every scenario where different frameworks, assemblies, third-party applications, and security solutions might be used (Fang et at., 2018).</p>

A well-designed and implemented software must be maintainable and extensible. It is an essential piece of an information system, along with the other components such as hardware, data, processes and people. They all must work highly coupled to provide a robust framework.</p>
              <p>We came across several examples of how even a small component of an information system might cause a catastrophic failure. It is the responsibility of every member of a team to work with the strongest of ethics to provide a service with the highest standards. We have seen examples of our fellow students that show how the quality of our work can impact the reputation of a company, the security of a critical facility, communications and transport of a whole country (Goodley, 2018), and even the freedom or the life of others (Prodger, 2013). We learned how every aspect should be considered when designing an information system. Complexity, resources, time, ethics, governance and team experience should all be carefully examined before committing.</p>
              <p>Another important concept researched during this module is Object-oriented software development. It is among the tools that provide a methodology to develop complex systems, focusing on the objects of a problem to provide a design that is maintainable, extensible and easy to read. With the increasing complexity of modern information systems, new challenges arise, making Object-Oriented Design harder to implement. It is very important to distinguish when to implement OOP (Aniche et al., 2019).</p>              
              <p>To sum up, we have gained valuable knowledge about tools and methods that must be considered when participating in the software development lifecycle. We have a clear understanding of the importance of requirements gathering, testing and selecting the right methodology for implementation.</p>

              <p class="lead">There are many advantages to this approach such as modularity, which makes it easier to maintain and expand, correct bugs, etc. OOD can improve reliability, flexibility and reusability. However, there are weaknesses if not used correctly or if the technique is abused, making the system hard and costly to integrate with other systems.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Abstraction: removes most superfluous details to leave the most important aspects of the object, so it is easier to use for other types. It represents a reusable, generic object.</p>
              <p>Encapsulation: it is the concept of joining methods and states (functions and attributes) together in a class. The data is not accessed directly but through the methods inside a class.</p>              
              <p>Inheritance: having a master class (or super class), other objects can inherit its characteristics (parent to child inheritance). In this case we say that the child is coupled with its parent (super class). Any changes made to the super class, will be transferred to the sub-class.</p>              
              <p>Polymorphism: occurs when more than one object inherits from a parent class, overriding its default behaviours, while keeping the IS-A relationship with its parent. One object can then take on many forms. </p>

              <p>Cyber-attacks from inside organisations are becoming more and more efficient year after year, with an increasing reputational and financial damage for many companies around the world. (Maglaras et Al., 2018). Some key concepts must be considered from the security point of view to improve detection and mitigation of attacks.</p>
              <h5>Access Control</h5>
              <p>To keep a secure access control inside a company, there are several measures that must be considered. From the point of view of network access, the most critical measure is a strong password policy that should enforce a strong password and an expiration period. This should be coupled with a two-step’s authentication method such as SMS or key authenticators. Other measures for internal assets protection include a restricted physical access to servers or other infrastructure resources that could be compromised in any way by malicious visitors or attackers.</p>
              <h5>Availability</h5>
              <p>General availability of every resource is always a bad idea. Resources should be restricted to those who really need it and prior authorization of people responsible. Approving use of resources is usually a good way to stablish a chain of responsibility that is not taken slightly by employees. With resource restriction, an attacker not only needs to have access to the network, but it also needs an account with permissions and with access to resources. Limiting resources will reduce de attack surface and attack vectors.</p>
              <h5>Confidentiality</h5>
              <p>Establishing trust and having a good information campaign can help the company to propagate the importance of data privacy regulations compliance. Most data privacy violations occur because of misinformation or lack of campaigns such as phishing tests.</p>
              <h5>Audit</h5>
              <p>One of the most common and effective forms of auditing is logging. Keeping a consistent logging policy can help detection of unusual activities from inside the organisation. One of the top OWASP vulnerabilities include insufficient logging and monitoring, which outlines how many breaches or incidents could be prevented or detected by establishing a strong logging and monitoring OWASP (2018).</p>
              <h5>Competence</h5>
              <p>Information campaigns can produce an excellent outcome in terms of security improvements. However, training of security personnel in network administration, policy enforcement, penetration testing, and any other security related knowledge is essential to avoid attacks from the outside and inside the company.</p>
