              <p>When a researcher is entitled to perform an analysis, the first ethical responsibility is to ensure compliance with any code of ethics involved. In the example discussed, Abi is a researcher and a statistical programmer. His task is to research and analyse nutritional information, so at least two codes of ethic might be involved. On one hand we have the European Federation of the Associations of Dietitians (EFAD) for Europe or the Code of Ethics for the Nutrition and Dietetics Profession in the United States (Eat Right Pro, 2018). On the other hand, we have the BCS code of conduct, which focus on the responsibilities as a computing professional.</p>
              <p>As described in the principle 4.a of the BCS code of conduct, the computing professional must not follow any behaviour that might compromise the reputation of the profession. The principle 1.a. is also violated in this case, where public interest should prevail by not having due regard for public health.</p>
              <p>According to Maroc & Larkin (2000) “the intentional misrepresentation of data is a form of fraud or deception”. The American Society for Nutrition grouped a board to focus on best practices to improve public opinion about researchers in general. This shows the interest of changing the opinion of those who feel nutrition reports might be misleading or compromised (Rucker & Rucker, 2016).</p>

              <p>Hi Kieron. Thank you for an enlightening post. I agree with you about Abi’s obligation to present both results. I think that as a computing professional he should comply act under the principles of one of the codes of conduct available for his jurisdiction. Whether it is the BCS, ACM or IEEE, they all encourage a fair and professional conduct and act in favour of the public interest. For example, the BCS Code of Conduct (2018: 2) in its principle 1.a. states that the professional shall “have due regard for public health, privacy, security and wellbeing of others”.</p>
              <p>Another interesting topic in your post is the involvement of the Advertising Standards Agency to enforce the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations. It seems there are several agencies that could act as a proxy to file a claim or notify relevant authorities of a misleading study. There are also additional codes of ethic for nutrition or dietetics such as the European Federation of the Associations of Dietitians (EFAD) code of ethics, or the Code of Ethics for the Nutrition and Dietetics Profession in the United States (Eat Right Pro, 2018). They are international standards that do not substitute for national standards but represent a solid basement for individuals or organizations working with ethical principles for the welfare of society.</p>

              <p>I agree with your thoughts on Abi’s options, which are totally valid. As a researcher, I would also include both sides of the story so that the company’s management decides how to deal with unfavourable reports. The primary duty of a computer scientist is to act in favour of the public interest according to principle 1.a. of the BCS code of conduct, having due regard for public health and the wellbeing of others (BCS, 2021). As a result, the main responsibility of the researcher should be to encourage the correct use of this information.</p>
              <p>An interesting debate may arise when we also include the duty to relevant authorities, which in this case is the manufacturer. The BCS code of conduct in its principle 3.a. requires the researcher to exercise his/her professional judgement while carrying out tasks assigned by the relevant authority. Additionally, the researcher might be bound to a confidentiality agreement that could prevent disclosing any information about the results. If the company decides on publishing the positive results only and they include the researcher as the source for these findings, it can be argued that the researcher is not failing to comply with the BCS code of conduct since it governs the conduct of the individual, not the ethics of the relevant authorities.</p>

              <p>It has been an educational experience to review so many different perspectives on the Abi’s case and his possibilities regarding the analysis results. Some of us agree with presenting both results to the customer, some of us agree on only communicating the negative outcome. Different conclusions may arise on how to proceed if the manufacturer decides to publish only the positive results of his investigation. However, the most critical discussion has been around the ethical implications of Abi’s actions as a computing professional and as a researcher. It is pleasant to realize that at this point, our peers are completely aware of their responsibilities to the public wellbeing and the profession.</p>
              <p>Criticality is another important topic that has been on discussion during the past three units. As a researcher, it is crucial to contrast and demonstrate a result from different angles, using the most appropriate methodology to gather data, analyse and transform it into knowledge. We have seen that knowledge is as good as the data and can be used in opposite ways.</p>
              <p>Personally, I have found that many regulatory entities and organisations can assist researchers into producing ethical results by offering code of conducts specific for a field. For example, in Europe we have the European Federation of the Associations of Dietitians (EFAD), and there is Eat Right Pro in the United States (Eat Right Pro, 2018). Part of our mission as computing professionals is to share this knowledge with our colleagues but also with the relevant authority. We might be bound to a confidentiality agreement, but we can always create awareness among our employers or customers so that we all work toward building a better society.</p>

              <p class="lead">Deep learning in agriculture: A survey</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The purpose of the paper is to compare different deep learning techniques with other frameworks and techniques such as image processing applied to tackle problems and challenges in agriculture. The type of research design used in this paper by Kamilaris and Prenafeta-Boldú (2018) is exploratory because there is no specific problem. Instead, the authors use a survey to compare different techniques and framework to go beyond other studies that only surveyed a few documents or papers.</p>
              <p>Regarding the research method, the author uses a quantitative research, where basically other papers or case studies are being surveyed to gather information and data from them. The questions they try to answer are: </p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-check"></i> What particular agricultural problem the paper address. </p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-check"></i> What Deep Learning models and architectures have been implemented.</p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-check"></i> What Data processing tools were used.</p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-check"></i> What was the overall performance achieved according to the metrics.</p>
              <p>Kamilaris and Prenafeta-Boldú support their conclusion with enough evidence, comparing around 40 different papers. They however, miss some other agriculture areas where there is no evidence of previous work using deep learning techniques, so they leave them for further investigation.</p>

              <p class="lead">Importance of research project</p>
              <p>According to Dawson (2015), it is important to organize a research project from the beginning. The author recommends classifying the project according to its type and put effort in crucial points such as originality, area of contribution, or knowledge and understanding. Dawson also recommends to clearly explain the project justification, include critical debate and its findings.</p>
              <hr>
              <p class="lead">Choosing a project</p>
              <p>It is important to consider several aspects such as the time available to complete the project. The complexity must be adequate for its duration. The research topic must be appealing so that the researcher keeps interest during the project.</p>
              <hr>

              <p class="lead">Project types</p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Research-based: focuses on an area, identifying weaknesses and strengths, gaps, improvement opportunities, etc.</p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Development: software, apps, hardware, methods, processes, designs, multimedia, etc.</p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Evaluation: compare different concepts, methodologies, issues, etc. It can use case studies. It can use several approaches to address a specific problem and compare them (such as comparing different SEPM methodologies.</p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Industry: it is developed for a specific client. The main drawback is that the customer could drive the project out of the boundaries or requirements of academic work.</p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Problem solving: use an existing theory or method to solve a new problem, or come up with a new solution/approach to an existing method to solve a problem.</p>

              <hr>
              <p class="lead">Originality</p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Techniques: new methods or methods used in way they have not been used before. They do not have to be successful, but research could show why they are suitable or why they are not.</p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Exploring the unknown: fields not researched before.</p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Unanticipated: explore on fields already investigated but with new perspective or interpretations.</p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Data: interpret data in a different way than before. </p>
              <hr>
              <p class="lead">Knowledge and understanding</p>

              <p><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Data: raw data (numbers or text) gathered for processing, also known as intelligence gathering.</p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Information: processed or summarized data will give meaningful information.</p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Knowledge: is the process of understanding the information and converting it into ideas. It is the application of methodologies, patterns, models, etc., to explain the information and respond to the ‘why’ of the information. </p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Wisdom: apply all the knowledge and experience to transform it into new knowledge or differentiate it from other knowledge and ideas.</p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Theory: is the final representation of the observations of the research. It does not mean it is true, but it is the conclusion after information is processed, converted to knowledge and explained as wisdom.</p>

              <p class="lead">How to perform research</p>
              
              <p><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Sequential: there are several models that suggest a series of steps to perform sequentially or in cycles. They normally start by selecting the field, then the focus of study, then the way to make the research and finally the theory. Models differ in how many steps take place.</p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Generalized: it is like the sequential process, but steps can be skipped or changed. There are alternative routes to the initial steps.</p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Circulatory: iterative process</p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Evolutionary: is like circulatory but it recognizes that it could change over time.</p>
