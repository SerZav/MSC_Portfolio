              <p>The introduction seminar left me enthusiastic about the content of the module. The fact that there is teamwork involved is also exciting. The teams will be formed by six members or more. It will make it challenging for communicating and agree on tools, availability, etc. However, it also represents a great opportunity to experience a more realistic approach than with a team of 3 members. </p>
              <p>Most people have limited time due to their full-time jobs, and not everyone is in the same time zone. Being acquainted with the SEPM duties, it became apparent that it would be challenging for anybody trying to manage the team. However, most of the participants seem very responsive to communication and willing to make the most out of the module.</p>
              <p>The first meeting with the tutor was short and some peers did not find it very useful. On the contrary, I think it was a good way to start building communication within the group. Otherwise, there is the risk of making a big team to start being productive too late into the module. I considered it as an opportunity to send a firm message that the tutor was going to be there for us along the module, which I appreciate.</p>

              <p>To me, complexity is the main cause of most project failures. There is a range of related causes related to complexity, such as available resources., technological gaps between new systems and legacy systems that have been running for years or decades, bureaucracy built-in large government or industrial ecosystems, among others. When a system is very complex, extra measures are required to avoid failure. The expertise of project managers and developers, testers, architects, designers, and everyone involved in the SDLC, must be suited for the task. Documentation and communication between all parties involved play a significant role in the project success. As an example of failure due to project complexity, we have the Boeing 737 Max that resulted in two plane crashes and put the project on hold for investigations (Johnston & Harris, 2019).</p>
              <p>For me, the second most important cause of project failures is related to people. It can be argued that there are many ramifications to this cause such as inexperienced developers and testers or poor management selection. This fact often weakens the foundations of the project. For example, we have the European Ariane 5 crash, 40 seconds after take-off (Jazequel & Meyer, 1997).</p>
              <p>Another common cause of failures is related to estimation and analysis. Again, we found this cause closely related to others such as people (poor management) or project complexity, which can lead to errors in estimation without the right people for the job. One of the most common examples to showcase this failure was the development of OS/360 by IBM, where multiple estimation problems occurred and were subsequently discussed, and documented (Brooks, 1974).</p>

              <p>Software Engineering Project Management requires knowledge of the phases involved in the Software Development Lifecycle, from the requirements to the deployment.

              <p class="lead">TOGAF Architecture Development Method</p>
              <p>It is a method that describes a cyclical pattern where four main phases iterate over the requirements of the project. These phases are:</p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i> Business: involves the preliminary, business vision and business architecture phases. The PM work with stakeholders and business architects to produce the initial documentation, design, agreements, etc.</p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i> IT: involves infrastructure architects, developers, and analysts to decide on platforms, infrastructure, and software architecture.</p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i> Planning: the PM creates the plans for the migration or the new solution proposal, showcasing opportunities and solutions. </p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i> Change: involve the possible changes that arise after some challenges or issues are encountered. These changes may need to revise the initial design, by making small changes or even forcing a new design cycle.</p>
              <p>Around 70% of the incidents are introduced in the initial phases. However, most incidents are identified in the final stages, which is more expensive for the project (Feiler, 2019).</p>
              <p class="lead">Common causes of project failures</p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i> Organisation and planning (scheduling, procurement, etc).</p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i> Leadership and governance: team and contractor management, poor strategic vision, or deficient direction through the development cycle.</p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i> Estimation and analysis: communication problems, bad estimation, bad design, communication, etc.</p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i> Quality: lack of testing and delivery management.</p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i> Risk: lack of risk assessment and modelling, lack of suitable tools to measure risks.</p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i> Skills and competency: poor design, poor implementation or poor testing due to lack of knowledge or unexperienced personnel. </p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i> Communication and engagement: bad expectation management (i.e., unrealistic projections or expectations), stakeholder management (i.e., bad communication during initial phases).</p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-circle"></i> Complexity: Unproven technologies used in complex systems, or integration with highly complex systems.</p>
              <p class="lead">About project failures</p>
              <p>According to Agarwal and Rathod (2006), it is almost impossible to agree whether a project was a success or a failure. It is common to see the scenario where developers think a project was a success while stakeholders think it was a complete failure.</p>
