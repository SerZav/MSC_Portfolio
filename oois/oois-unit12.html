              <p>In this unit, I had the opportunity to research emerging trends and reflect upon the ethical and security implications of those in our lives. Privacy is our main concern, but sometimes we are surrounded by silent technology that is gathering data of everything we do and opening potential security breaches.</p>
              <p>As Computer Scientists we must be aware of the security and ethical implications of every information system we have the opportunity to be involved with, whether we are designing, developing, or just acting as consultants.</p>
              <p>I enjoyed the possibility to make a blog and participate in this module overall, where I have gathered a considerable amount of information that I have to keep cultivating. The main concern for me is going to be reinforcing several important topics that I found both interesting and challenging, but I am sure that I have developed enough resilience and time management to tackle them as I keep going through the course.</p>

              <p></p>
              <p>We are going through an amazing era for Information Systems, which are growing at an exponential rate. While it is true that they received a big boost because of the pandemic, which forced many industries into a digital transformation, it is also true that we were already feeling this boom toward incorporating artificial intelligence, cloud services, and of course, the internet of things (commonly known as IoT).</p>
              <h5>But how is IoT evolving and what can we expect in the near future? </h5>
              <p>We are already seen how IoT is being incorporated to into our lives when we buy a smart light bulb, or a thermostat that keeps our house warm before we even arrive, or the freezer that remembers us to buy milk. However, there are other not-so-obvious applications for this emerging technology.</p>
              <p>IoT and 5G networks will be working together to bring a more reliable smart healthcare system where low latency, high reliability and speed, together with the possibility of connecting millions of devices, can save many lives. From devices with smart detection of fluids, ambulance control, urgent medicine geo-location, to information gathering devices from many sources for machine learning applications, we will see a total revolution in the healthcare system (Ahad et al., 2020).</p>
              <p>We can see IoT developing in many different areas such as food delivery, where even fresh deliverables can be tracked for temperature while being transported; agriculture, with sensors that keep track of humidity of the soil, temperature, and many other essential measurements (Usha et al., 2021); even climate change specialists have their hopes on IoT, which helps to analyse and monitor the ecological condition for decision making (Rayan et al., 2021).</p>
              <p>If the go a step further, we find M-IoT, where cloud-computing, mobile networks and IoT collide. This paradigm involves many devices such as vehicles, smart-watches and mobiles phones, being converted in mini-cloud consumers with the power of cloud services (and the dangers related to it) in your hand (Lee & Lee, 2021).</p>
              <h5>Ethical challenges ahead.</h5>
              <p>We keep seen wonderful applications for IoT and its adoption will keep growing non-stop, but as it goes deeper into our lives, we lose privacy and control over it (Karale, 2021). The GDPR and its equivalents over the world must be as fast as the adoption of these emerging technologies to protect our privacy. We have to encourage research and control over these technologies that will be in every step of the way from now on.</p>
