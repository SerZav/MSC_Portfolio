              <p>In this unit we had the opportunity to research and discuss about the basics of designing under the object-oriented principles. It is critical to apply this knowledge from the beginning of every project to avoid potential problems. A good design is always more straightforward to discuss, modify and maintain. I found the Lucid Chart tool extremely valuable and powerful. Companies such as Amazon use these tools in a regular basis to support their teams.</p>
              <p>At first glance, many of the concepts of composition vs aggregation appear confusing. We hold interesting discussions about how to enhance the design in the practical activity, where it was evident that there is a thin line between these concepts and require more practice and research in the upcoming modules. This was very positive to the group, helping us to see our blunders and to get a more reliable understanding of the reasoning process of others.</p>

              <p>Between 6 and 7 December 2018, a software failure brought the O2 network down, affecting data services for more than 30 million users in the UK. Other companies that relied on O2 network such as Lycamobile, Giffgaff, Sky Mobile and Tesco Mobile were also affected. London’s bus stop screens and systems aboard more than 8500 London buses also failed due to this incident (Goodley, 2018). O2 offered several types of compensation for its customers depending on their plan, including discounts or credit of days’ worth charges.</p>
              <p>The failure was caused by an out-of-date licence in a software used by several hardware devices distributed by Ericsson. In total, 11 countries were affected by this failure, causing considerable reputation and monetary damage. O2 was asking for a compensation of as much as 100 million pounds from Ericsson (Goodley, 2018).</p>              
              <p>Ericsson (2018: 1) declared:</p>              
              <p>“During December 6, 2018, Ericsson has identified an issue in certain nodes in the core network resulting in network disturbances for a limited number of customers in multiple countries using two specific software versions of the SGSN–MME”.</p>
              <p>In another press release, SoftBank Corp., a Japanese telecommunications company apologized for the incident that affected their mobile customers nationwide (SoftBank Corp., 2018).</p>

              <p class="lead">Solomon presented an interesting case study where system complexity was highly underestimated. The Queensland health authority in Australia probably made the wrong choice when hiring IBM, even though they did not have experience in similar projects at the time.<p/>
              <hr>
              <p>It seems this is a good example of how to do everything wrong. The healthcare authority was slow to audit and keep track of progress, which brings the first big problem: governance.</p>
              <p>Strictly speaking about the information system design, there was deficient documentation of requirements for a system of such enormous complexity. The time commitment for the initial delivery seemed too short, and without a strict testing plan, it was an impossible task. These issues can be summarized as communication failure. In a project of this size, every effort must be directed toward stablishing good lines of communication between the consultants and every required personnel inside the company.</p>              
              <p>Grierson (2013: 9) stated: “Department of education, health and CorpTech senior officers were openly critical of the performance of IBM and I was concerned for the future of the relationship with IBM and hence the project”.</p>

              <p class="fst-italic">"Hi Kikelomo,</p>
              <p class="fst-italic">It seems that this example showcases a complete failure of several components of an information system. The hardware component along with network and communications components were not planned accordingly to such an important task. The software component also failed, making it impossible to print out vote results. </p>              
              <p class="fst-italic">It could be argued that the other components of the information system also failed. For example, the people component comprises all those involved in the process, from the testers to the officers who validated the system despite criticism and problems. The data and process components did not deliver the required results for the information system. All the components work together, and it might be considered that only the software failed, but in the end, it is a whole system where every component plays its part to make it work successfully."</p>

              <p>During the first weeks of this module, we went through the phases of the software development lifecycle, researching the importance of every step in order to efficiently build a project that meets the client’s requirements. A well-designed and implemented software must be maintainable and extensible. It is an essential piece of an information system, along with the other components such as hardware, data, processes and people. They all must work highly coupled to provide a robust framework.</p>
              <p>We came across several examples of how even a small component of an information system might cause a catastrophic failure. It is the responsibility of every member of a team to work with the strongest of ethics to provide a service with the highest standards. We have seen examples of our fellow students that show how the quality of our work can impact the reputation of a company, the security of a critical facility, communications and transport of a whole country (Goodley, 2018), and even the freedom or the life of others (Prodger, 2013). We learned how every aspect should be considered when designing an information system. Complexity, resources, time, ethics, governance and team experience should all be carefully examined before committing.</p>
              <p>Another important concept researched during this module is Object-oriented software development. It is among the tools that provide a methodology to develop complex systems, focusing on the objects of a problem to provide a design that is maintainable, extensible and easy to read. With the increasing complexity of modern information systems, new challenges arise, making Object-Oriented Design harder to implement. It is very important to distinguish when to implement OOP (Aniche et al., 2019).</p>              
              <p>To sum up, we have gained valuable knowledge about tools and methods that must be considered when participating in the software development lifecycle. We have a clear understanding of the importance of requirements gathering, testing and selecting the right methodology for implementation.</p>

              <p class="lead">There are many advantages to this approach such as modularity, which makes it easier to maintain and expand, correct bugs, etc. OOD can improve reliability, flexibility and reusability. However, there are weaknesses if not used correctly or if the technique is abused, making the system hard and costly to integrate with other systems.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Abstraction: removes most superfluous details to leave the most important aspects of the object, so it is easier to use for other types. It represents a reusable, generic object.</p>
              <p>Encapsulation: it is the concept of joining methods and states (functions and attributes) together in a class. The data is not accessed directly but through the methods inside a class.</p>              
              <p>Inheritance: having a master class (or super class), other objects can inherit its characteristics (parent to child inheritance). In this case we say that the child is coupled with its parent (super class). Any changes made to the super class, will be transferred to the sub-class.</p>              
              <p>Polymorphism: occurs when more than one object inherits from a parent class, overriding its default behaviours, while keeping the IS-A relationship with its parent. One object can then take on many forms. </p>
