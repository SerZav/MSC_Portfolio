              <p>One of my goals with this course is to establish a solid foundation to become a software architect. I have been able to reinforce good practices with Python, which will help me avoid potential bugs. My experience with Python is limited, but it is easy to write and read, versatile, and has a large community behind it; I will keep using it for learning architectural patterns.</p>
              <p>Since I work as a developer, I did not feel the Codio activities were challenging, but they contributed to practising Python and having a common language with our peers. I had previous experience with bug-checking tools such as Pylint, but eventually, I stopped using them. It was a great reminder that these tools help increase readability and therefore, improve teamwork, code quality, and reliability.</p>

              <p>Between 6 and 7 December 2018, a software failure brought the O2 network down, affecting data services for more than 30 million users in the UK. Other companies that relied on O2 network such as Lycamobile, Giffgaff, Sky Mobile and Tesco Mobile were also affected. London’s bus stop screens and systems aboard more than 8500 London buses also failed due to this incident (Goodley, 2018). O2 offered several types of compensation for its customers depending on their plan, including discounts or credit of days’ worth charges.</p>
              <p>The failure was caused by an out-of-date licence in a software used by several hardware devices distributed by Ericsson. In total, 11 countries were affected by this failure, causing considerable reputation and monetary damage. O2 was asking for a compensation of as much as 100 million pounds from Ericsson (Goodley, 2018).</p>              
              <p>Ericsson (2018: 1) declared:</p>              
              <p>“During December 6, 2018, Ericsson has identified an issue in certain nodes in the core network resulting in network disturbances for a limited number of customers in multiple countries using two specific software versions of the SGSN–MME”.</p>
              <p>In another press release, SoftBank Corp., a Japanese telecommunications company apologized for the incident that affected their mobile customers nationwide (SoftBank Corp., 2018).</p>

              <p class="lead">Solomon presented an interesting case study where system complexity was highly underestimated. The Queensland health authority in Australia probably made the wrong choice when hiring IBM, even though they did not have experience in similar projects at the time.<p/>
              <hr>
              <p>It seems this is a good example of how to do everything wrong. The healthcare authority was slow to audit and keep track of progress, which brings the first big problem: governance.</p>
              <p>Strictly speaking about the information system design, there was deficient documentation of requirements for a system of such enormous complexity. The time commitment for the initial delivery seemed too short, and without a strict testing plan, it was an impossible task. These issues can be summarized as communication failure. In a project of this size, every effort must be directed toward stablishing good lines of communication between the consultants and every required personnel inside the company.</p>              
              <p>Grierson (2013: 9) stated: “Department of education, health and CorpTech senior officers were openly critical of the performance of IBM and I was concerned for the future of the relationship with IBM and hence the project”.</p>

              <p class="lead">Kikelomo brought to our attention an interesting case of failure during the 2004 Irish elections, where the Irish government tried to replace the manual voting system by an electronic one. The system turned out to be flawed and had to be discarded just 5 days prior to the elections.<p/>

              <p class="fst-italic">"Hi Kikelomo,</p>
              <p class="fst-italic">It seems that this example showcases a complete failure of several components of an information system. The hardware component along with network and communications components were not planned accordingly to such an important task. The software component also failed, making it impossible to print out vote results. </p>              
              <p class="fst-italic">It could be argued that the other components of the information system also failed. For example, the people component comprises all those involved in the process, from the testers to the officers who validated the system despite criticism and problems. The data and process components did not deliver the required results for the information system. All the components work together, and it might be considered that only the software failed, but in the end, it is a whole system where every component plays its part to make it work successfully."</p>

              <p>Three of the most exploited vulnerabilities have been exposed since 1998, and they could have been prevented through correct software design. For example, buffer error occurs when the attacker has access to a parameter that is not properly handled to be allocated on the heap (example, a buffer of 256 that is not checked, and a parameter with size >256 is inserted). An exception will be generated.</p>
              <p>To avoid memory buffer errors, programming languages use abstractions to manage memory, but it comes with a performance cost.  If this performance decrease is important for the development, such as in embedded systems.</p>
              <p>Even most of the top programming languages are not listed as the most secure, it all comes down to using the right procedures such as testing, good practices such as design patterns or SOLID principles, and keeping a secure approach for updates.</p>
              <p>Python has been improving during the last years and it could be used to program a simple shell, but in terms of efficiency and speed, I would still favour more low-level languages such as C / C++. The downside is that the time to complete such a project would be much longer, and error prone, which needs a bigger team to test, support, and maintain it effectively.</p>
              <h5>Could Python be classed as a secure language?</h5>
              <p>Based on Cifuentes and Bierman’s (2019), requirements of a secure programming language, none of the top 10 mainstream languages can be considered as secure.</p>
              <p>Pillai (2017) mentions buffer overflow errors as one of the security vulnerabilities of Python. xrange() and len() are example of Python functions prone to integer overflow errors.</p>
              <p>“Code injection is a risk with languages that execute or interpret script because of the ease of running a string as an executable statement or statements at runtime (commonly called “eval”). For example, popular languages that have this ability include: JavaScript, Perl, Python, and Ruby.” (Kohnfelder et al., 2019).</p>

              <p>During the first weeks of this module, we went through the phases of the software development lifecycle, researching the importance of every step in order to efficiently build a project that meets the client’s requirements. A well-designed and implemented software must be maintainable and extensible. It is an essential piece of an information system, along with the other components such as hardware, data, processes and people. They all must work highly coupled to provide a robust framework.</p>
              <p>We came across several examples of how even a small component of an information system might cause a catastrophic failure. It is the responsibility of every member of a team to work with the strongest of ethics to provide a service with the highest standards. We have seen examples of our fellow students that show how the quality of our work can impact the reputation of a company, the security of a critical facility, communications and transport of a whole country (Goodley, 2018), and even the freedom or the life of others (Prodger, 2013). We learned how every aspect should be considered when designing an information system. Complexity, resources, time, ethics, governance and team experience should all be carefully examined before committing.</p>
              <p>Another important concept researched during this module is Object-oriented software development. It is among the tools that provide a methodology to develop complex systems, focusing on the objects of a problem to provide a design that is maintainable, extensible and easy to read. With the increasing complexity of modern information systems, new challenges arise, making Object-Oriented Design harder to implement. It is very important to distinguish when to implement OOP (Aniche et al., 2019).</p>              
              <p>To sum up, we have gained valuable knowledge about tools and methods that must be considered when participating in the software development lifecycle. We have a clear understanding of the importance of requirements gathering, testing and selecting the right methodology for implementation.</p>

              <p class="lead">There are many advantages to this approach such as modularity, which makes it easier to maintain and expand, correct bugs, etc. OOD can improve reliability, flexibility and reusability. However, there are weaknesses if not used correctly or if the technique is abused, making the system hard and costly to integrate with other systems.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Abstraction: removes most superfluous details to leave the most important aspects of the object, so it is easier to use for other types. It represents a reusable, generic object.</p>
              <p>Encapsulation: it is the concept of joining methods and states (functions and attributes) together in a class. The data is not accessed directly but through the methods inside a class.</p>              
              <p>Inheritance: having a master class (or super class), other objects can inherit its characteristics (parent to child inheritance). In this case we say that the child is coupled with its parent (super class). Any changes made to the super class, will be transferred to the sub-class.</p>              
              <p>Polymorphism: occurs when more than one object inherits from a parent class, overriding its default behaviours, while keeping the IS-A relationship with its parent. One object can then take on many forms. </p>
