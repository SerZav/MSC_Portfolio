              <p>The team exercise allowed us to experiment with the impact of connecting from different locations, varying the number of routings needed to connect to the same target, and how it can be interpreted in different ways depending on previous experiences. Sharing this experience with other peers increased the tool availability and allowed me to get acquainted with technologies I am not used to.</p>
              <p>The work carried out during this unit has delivered a great insight into our capabilities to interact with peers with different technical backgrounds and skills, as well as different cultural profiles. I want to focus on improving my communication skills to help my involvement in international teams and projects. I need to take the lead in situations where the team is lacking direction. I proved myself capable of contributing with lots of new and fresh ideas as well as improve those of others; however, I must improve my skills in wider reading and research to contribute in more depth and beyond the expectations of the task.</p>

              <p>In a study to examine the risk of a production training resource's security being compromised by attackers, several vulnerabilities were found without implementing sophisticated resources. In this study performed by students with basic knowledge and limited tools, a medical mannequin was successfully attacked, demonstrating a low level of security implemented to protect these devices (Glisson et al., 2015).</p>
              <p>One of the vulnerabilities found in the security solution led to the successful use of a brute force attack to penetrate the internal router, which allowed access to the device. According to an alert from the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency in 2012, access points that support WPS are sensible of being breached by attackers in a time frame between 4 and 10 hours with open-source tools (Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, 2012). The steps to follow include updating the access point firmware and disabling the WPS. Therefore, it is essential to keep updated information on these alerts and reports about security.</p>
              <p>Attacks on WPS/WPS2 security can be greatly enhanced by using dictionaries. One of the most important measures to increase protection against these attacks is to perform penetration tests, with tools that measure the weakness of the security solution (Ajay et al., 2021). WPS3 however, has a more robust protection against password dictionary attacks and other vulnerabilities and adoption of devices with this protocol is advised (Lounis & Zulkernine, 2019).</p>
              <p>The second vulnerability found was related to the network protocol, which led to a denial of service, preventing the software to communicate with the mannequin. The most important measure to prevent DoS attacks or DDoS attacks in IoT devices is detection, for example monitoring network traffic. Other measures include prevention, by whitelisting the pre-approved devices allowed to connect to the device or implementing a firewall (Salim et al., 2020).</p>

              <p>Hi Kike,</p>
              <p>I found your post very interesting, and I also agree that increasing staff training in cybersecurity or at least network security would beneficiate hospitals implementing these training systems. It could even help detect some failures that the manufacturer of such training devices (such as the health mannequin) could have missed. It is still the responsibility of the mannequin provider to test it against every possible intrusion, using penetration testing and ethical hacking techniques. This issue will become more and more evident as Smart devices and AI applications are scattered through the health ecosystem (Perumal et al., 2021).</p>
              <p>From the point of view of manufacturers, it seems they are not planning the security measures that might be necessary to tackle future threats. I wonder what you think about how the target customer of the mannequin, could have influenced the low security of the mannequin. A simple update of the internal network router might correct the issue that allowed an attacker to take advantage of the WPS vulnerability (Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, 2012).</p>

              <p class="fst-italic">"Peer response:</p>
              <p class="fst-italic">I enjoyed your post very much since there are interesting facts about healthcare security. I agree with your measures to mitigate these attacks, especially when you talk about updating the firmware of the internal devices. This risk to brute force attacks was warned by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency back in 2012. The stated that a WPS vulnerability could be used by an attacker to get the router's password (Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, 2012).</p>              
              <p class="fst-italic">Additionally, I think that improving staff training in cybersecurity would beneficiate hospitals implementing these devices securely. It is an opportunity to keep the hospital safe and could help detecting vulnerabilities that the manufacturer could have missed in early stages of development. It is still the responsibility of the mannequin provider to test it against every possible intrusion, using penetration testing and ethical hacking techniques. This issue will become more and more evident as Smart devices and AI applications are scattered through the health ecosystem (Perumal et al., 2021)."</p>

              <p>During the first weeks of this module, we went through the phases of the software development lifecycle, researching the importance of every step in order to efficiently build a project that meets the client’s requirements. A well-designed and implemented software must be maintainable and extensible. It is an essential piece of an information system, along with the other components such as hardware, data, processes and people. They all must work highly coupled to provide a robust framework.</p>
              <p>We came across several examples of how even a small component of an information system might cause a catastrophic failure. It is the responsibility of every member of a team to work with the strongest of ethics to provide a service with the highest standards. We have seen examples of our fellow students that show how the quality of our work can impact the reputation of a company, the security of a critical facility, communications and transport of a whole country (Goodley, 2018), and even the freedom or the life of others (Prodger, 2013). We learned how every aspect should be considered when designing an information system. Complexity, resources, time, ethics, governance and team experience should all be carefully examined before committing.</p>
              <p>Another important concept researched during this module is Object-oriented software development. It is among the tools that provide a methodology to develop complex systems, focusing on the objects of a problem to provide a design that is maintainable, extensible and easy to read. With the increasing complexity of modern information systems, new challenges arise, making Object-Oriented Design harder to implement. It is very important to distinguish when to implement OOP (Aniche et al., 2019).</p>              
              <p>To sum up, we have gained valuable knowledge about tools and methods that must be considered when participating in the software development lifecycle. We have a clear understanding of the importance of requirements gathering, testing and selecting the right methodology for implementation.</p>

              <p class="lead">There are many advantages to this approach such as modularity, which makes it easier to maintain and expand, correct bugs, etc. OOD can improve reliability, flexibility and reusability. However, there are weaknesses if not used correctly or if the technique is abused, making the system hard and costly to integrate with other systems.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Abstraction: removes most superfluous details to leave the most important aspects of the object, so it is easier to use for other types. It represents a reusable, generic object.</p>
              <p>Encapsulation: it is the concept of joining methods and states (functions and attributes) together in a class. The data is not accessed directly but through the methods inside a class.</p>              
              <p>Inheritance: having a master class (or super class), other objects can inherit its characteristics (parent to child inheritance). In this case we say that the child is coupled with its parent (super class). Any changes made to the super class, will be transferred to the sub-class.</p>              
              <p>Polymorphism: occurs when more than one object inherits from a parent class, overriding its default behaviours, while keeping the IS-A relationship with its parent. One object can then take on many forms. </p>
